# Movie Browser Readme

## Instructions

To run and test the Movie App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Open your web browser and access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.


## Elements Demonstrating Proficiency

### 1. Infinite Scrolling

I implemented infinite scrolling on the List page to enhance user experience. When the user reaches the bottom of the movie list, additional movies are automatically loaded. This demonstrates my proficiency in handling dynamic data loading and improving the app's usability.

### 2. Search Functionality

The app allows users to search for movies using the search API. Search results are displayed on the List page, and when the search is canceled, it reverts to showing all movies as required. This showcases my ability to integrate external APIs, manage state, and handle user interactions effectively.

### 3. Responsive Design

I ensured that the app's design is responsive, with a minimum width of 512 pixels. This responsive design approach demonstrates my skill in creating user-friendly interfaces that work seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

### 4. State Management and Routing

I used a state management library of my choice i.e. Redux to efficiently manage the app's state, ensuring data consistency and a smooth user experience. Additionally, I utilized common routing libraries (e.g., React Router) to implement page navigation, enabling users to move between the List and Details pages effortlessly.

### 5. Movie Details Page

The Details page displays essential movie information, such as title, rating, release year, length, director, cast, and description. This page design showcases my ability to create a well-structured and informative user interface, providing users with comprehensive movie details.


## Improvements with Additional Time

If I had four more hours available for this task, I would focus on the following improvements:

1. **Testing**: I would expand the test coverage to include more comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using tools like Jest. This would ensure the app's reliability and robustness.

2. **Pagination**: While infinite scrolling is implemented, I would add optional pagination controls for users who prefer manual paging. This would provide users with more control over the browsing experience.

3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling by implementing error boundaries and displaying user-friendly error messages when API requests fail or other errors occur.

4. **Optimization**: Optimize the app's performance by implementing code splitting, lazy loading of components, and optimizing image loading to reduce initial load times and enhance the user experience.

5. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching of API responses to reduce the number of network requests and improve app responsiveness.

6. **UI/UX Polish**: Refine the user interface with animations, transitions, and subtle visual enhancements to provide a more polished and engaging user experience.

7. **Code Refactoring**: Review and refactor the codebase to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

These improvements would further enhance the app's functionality, performance, and user experience.
